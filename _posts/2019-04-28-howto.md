You can introduce this jekyll theme into your own site by either

- [Fork][5] this repository and add your markdown posts to the `_posts` folder, then
  push to your own Github repository.
- Use as a remote theme in your [`_config.yml`][6](just like what we do for this
  site itself),

```yaml
# Configurations
title:            Jekyll Gitbook
longtitle:        Jekyll Gitbook

remote_theme:     sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook
```

> ##### TIP
>
> No need to push generated HTML bundle.
